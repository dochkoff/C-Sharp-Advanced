## Course Description


The [C# Advanced](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3957/csharp-advanced-january-2023) course builds on the skills of working with the C# language and the .NET platform by examining more complex concepts typical of the language. In the course you will learn to create and work with linear data structures. You will build on your knowledge of working with arrays by learning to work with multidimensional arrays or matrices. You will have the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Generic concept - creating template classes and methods. You will solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories. Attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the main tool based on it - LINQ for data flow processing.
